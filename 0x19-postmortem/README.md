### Postmortem    
==============      
Any software system will eventually fail, and that failure can come stem from a wide range of possible factors such as bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, human error.    
Therefore, there is need to ensure such failure would not happen again. One important tool to evaluate software failure is the `Postmortem`.     
This a tool widely used in the tech industry. After an outage, the team in charge of the system will write summary containing two main goals:     
* Providing the rest of the company's employees with easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage.    
* And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.
